    Test the determinant of various matrices.
    
    This function evaluates the determinant of different types of matrices, including the identity matrix, zero matrix, one matrix, and the transpose of a matrix. It checks that the determinant of an identity matrix is 1, the determinant of a zero matrix is 0, the determinant of a one matrix is as expected, and the determinant of a one matrix with a specific size is 1. It also verifies that the determinant of the transpose of a matrix is the same as
