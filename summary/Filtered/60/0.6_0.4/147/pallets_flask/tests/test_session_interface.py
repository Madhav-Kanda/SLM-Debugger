    """
    Tests the open_session method of the session interface to ensure it raises an assertion if request.endpoint is None.
    
    This function sets up a Flask application with a custom session interface that fails if request.endpoint is None. It then tests the / endpoint to confirm that the session interface's open_session method does not raise an assertion error, indicating that request.endpoint is not None.
    
    Key Parameters:
    - None
    
    Key Returns:
    - None
    
    Side Effects:
    - The function makes a request to the Flask application's root endpoint
