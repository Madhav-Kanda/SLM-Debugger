    Test the deep copy and shallow copy behavior of a TextPath object.
    
    This function checks the deep copy and shallow copy behavior of a TextPath object. It ensures that a deep copy results in a new set of vertices that are not the same object as the original, while a shallow copy shares the same vertices.
    
    Parameters:
    None
    
    Returns:
    None
