    Generate a preview of a LaTeX expression representing a piecewise function.
    
    This function takes a piecewise function and generates a preview of its LaTeX
    representation. The preview is saved as a PNG image in a BytesIO buffer.
    
    Parameters:
    pw (Piecewise): The piecewise function to be previewed.
    
    Returns:
    None: The preview is saved to a BytesIO buffer and not returned.
    
    Raises:
    RuntimeError: If the LaTeX package is not installed, which is expected in
    certain environments
