    Test the LU decomposition of a matrix.
    
    This function performs LU decomposition on a given matrix `X` and checks if the resulting lower triangular matrix `L` and upper triangular matrix `U` have the same shape as the input matrix. It also verifies that `L` is a lower triangular matrix and `U` is an upper triangular matrix.
    
    Parameters:
    X (numpy.ndarray): The input matrix to be decomposed into LU form.
    
    Returns:
    L (numpy.ndarray): The lower triangular matrix
