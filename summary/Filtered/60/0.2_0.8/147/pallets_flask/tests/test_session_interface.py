def test_open_session_endpoint_not_none():
    """
    Test the open_session method of a session interface to ensure it raises an assertion if request.endpoint is None.
    
    This function sets up a Flask application with a custom session interface that will raise an assertion error if request.endpoint is None during the open_session method. The test checks that the endpoint is not None by making a request to the index route, which is defined to return "Hello World!". If the request.endpoint is None, the test will fail due to the assertion in the session interface.
    
    Parameters:
