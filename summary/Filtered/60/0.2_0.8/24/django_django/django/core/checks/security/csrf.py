    Function to check if the CSRF cookie is secure.
    
    This function evaluates whether the CSRF cookie is set to be secure, which means it will only be sent over HTTPS. It checks if the CSRF_USE_SESSIONS setting is enabled, if the CSRF middleware is not present, or if the CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE setting is True. If any of these conditions are met, the function returns an empty list indicating the check has passed. Otherwise, it returns a list containing a warning code W016.
