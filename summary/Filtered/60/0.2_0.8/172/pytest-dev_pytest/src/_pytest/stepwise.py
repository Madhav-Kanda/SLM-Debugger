    Add command line options for stepwise testing.
    
    This function is designed to be called by pytest to add custom command line options for stepwise testing. It allows users to specify whether the testing should proceed stepwise, meaning it should exit on test failure and continue from the last failing test on subsequent runs. Additionally, it provides an option to skip the first failing test but stop on the next failing test.
    
    Parameters:
    parser (argparse.ArgumentParser): The pytest argument parser to which the options will be added
