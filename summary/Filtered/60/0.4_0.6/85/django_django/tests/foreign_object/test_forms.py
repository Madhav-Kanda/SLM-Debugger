        Test the form for the Article model.
        
        This test checks that the form for the Article model correctly handles the publication date and ensures that non-concrete fields (like active_translation) are not included in the form fields. The test also verifies that the form can be used to create and update an instance of the Article model, ensuring that the publication date is saved correctly.

        - form: The form instance for the Article model.
        
        Key Steps:
        1. Check that the form includes the 'pub_date
