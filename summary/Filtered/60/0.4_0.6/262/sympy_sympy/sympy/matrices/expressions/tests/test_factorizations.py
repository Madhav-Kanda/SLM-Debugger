    Test the LU decomposition of a matrix.
    
    This function performs LU decomposition on the input matrix `X` and returns the lower triangular matrix `L` and upper triangular matrix `U`. The shapes of `L`, `U`, and `X` are expected to be identical. Additionally, `L` is expected to be a lower triangular matrix and `U` is expected to be an upper triangular matrix.
    
    Parameters:
    X (numpy.ndarray): The input matrix to be decomposed.
    
    Returns:
