def test_open_session_endpoint_not_none():
    """
    Test the open_session method of a session interface to ensure it raises an assertion if request.endpoint is None.
    
    This function sets up a Flask application with a custom session interface that fails if request.endpoint is None during the open_session method. It then tests the index route to ensure that the session interface does not raise an assertion error, indicating that request.endpoint is not None.
    
    Key Parameters:
    - None
    
    Key Returns:
    - None
    
    Side Effects:
    - The function makes a request to the Flask application's index
