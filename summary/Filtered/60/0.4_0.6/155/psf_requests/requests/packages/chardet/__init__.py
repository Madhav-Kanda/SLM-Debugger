    Detect the encoding of a given buffer of bytes.

    aBuf (bytes): The buffer of bytes to analyze for encoding.
    
    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary containing the detected encoding and other relevant information.
    
    This function uses the `UniversalDetector` class from the `universaldetector` module to analyze a buffer of bytes and determine the most likely encoding. The result is returned as a dictionary.
