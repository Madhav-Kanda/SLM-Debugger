def test_open_session_endpoint_not_none():
    """
    This function tests the open_session endpoint for a Flask application to ensure it does not return None. It uses a custom session interface that raises an assertion error if request.endpoint is None. The function defines a simple Flask route and sets the custom session interface. It then sends a test request to the route and checks if the response status code is 200, indicating that request.endpoint was not None.
    
    Key Parameters:
    - None
    
    Key Keywords:
    - None
    
    Input:
