    Generate a preview of a LaTeX expression representing a piecewise function.
    
    This function takes a piecewise function and generates a preview of its LaTeX representation as an image.
    The image is saved in PNG format and stored in a BytesIO buffer.
    
    Parameters:
    pw (Piecewise): The piecewise function to be previewed.
    
    Returns:
