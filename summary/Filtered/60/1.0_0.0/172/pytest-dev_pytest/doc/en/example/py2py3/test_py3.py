    Test exception handling syntax.
    
    This function demonstrates the use of a try-except block to handle a ZeroDivisionError. It attempts to divide 0 by 0, which raises a ZeroDivisionError. The exception is caught and an assertion is made to ensure that the exception object is not None.
    
    Parameters:
    None
    
    Returns:
    None
