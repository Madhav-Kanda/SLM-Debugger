    Generate a PNG preview of a Unicode symbol.
    
    This function creates a PNG preview of a given Unicode symbol and outputs it to a BytesIO object. If the LaTeX package is not installed, a `RuntimeError` will be caught and ignored.
    
    Parameters:
    a (Symbol): The Unicode symbol to preview.
    
    Returns:
    None: The preview is saved in a BytesIO object instead of being displayed.
