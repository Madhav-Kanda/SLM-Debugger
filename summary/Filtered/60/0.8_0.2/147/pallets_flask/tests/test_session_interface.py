    Tests the behavior of the open_session method in a session interface when request.endpoint is None.
    
    This function sets up a Flask application with a custom session interface that raises an assertion if request.endpoint is None. It then defines a simple route and tests the endpoint to ensure that the session interface behaves correctly when request.endpoint is not None.
    
    Key Parameters:
    - None
    
    Key Returns:
    - None
    
    Key Notes:
    - The function does not return any value but asserts that the request.endpoint is not None when the session
