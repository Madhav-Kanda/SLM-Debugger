    Test the open_session method of the session interface to ensure it raises an assertion if request.endpoint is None.
    
    This function sets up a Flask application with a custom session interface that will raise an assertion error if request.endpoint is None during the open_session method. The test checks that the endpoint is not None by making a request to the index route and verifying that the response status code is 200.
    
    Parameters:
    - None
    
    Returns:
    - None
    
    Key Points:
    - A Flask application is created and
