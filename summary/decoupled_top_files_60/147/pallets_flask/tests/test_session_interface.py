def test_open_session_endpoint_not_none():
    """
    Test the open session endpoint for a Flask application.
    
    This function checks if the request.endpoint is not None when the open_session method of a custom session interface is called. It uses a custom session interface that raises an assertion error if request.endpoint is None. The function defines a simple Flask route and uses the custom session interface to ensure that the endpoint is properly set.
    
    Parameters:
    None
    
    Returns:
    None
    
    Key Points:
    - Uses a custom session interface (MySessionInterface) that asserts request.endpoint
