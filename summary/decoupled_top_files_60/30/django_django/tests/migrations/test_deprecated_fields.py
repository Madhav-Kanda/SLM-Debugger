        This function ensures that the migration process works as expected for the 'migrations_ipaddressfield' model. It checks that the table does not exist initially, runs the migration to create the table, and then unmigrates to ensure the table is removed. The function uses the `call_command` method to execute the migration commands and `assertTableExists` and `assertTableNotExists` to verify the state of the database
