        This function tests the form for the Article model, ensuring that non-concrete fields (like 'active_translation') do not generate form fields. It also checks the form's validation and saving capabilities. The form is instantiated and validated with different data, and the save method is used to create and update instances of the Article model.

        - form: The form instance for the Article model.
        
        Key Steps:
        1. Check that the 'pub_date' field is
