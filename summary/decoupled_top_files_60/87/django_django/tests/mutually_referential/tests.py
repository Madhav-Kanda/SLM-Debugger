        Test the functionality of a mutually referential relationship in a database model.
        
        This test function checks the behavior of a Parent model that has a mutually referential relationship with its children. Specifically, it creates a Parent instance and several Child instances associated with it. It then sets one of the children as the 'bestchild' and saves the changes to the database. Finally, it deletes the Parent instance, ensuring that the relationships and data integrity are maintained.
