The provided Python file contains a Django management command class named `Command`, which inherits from `AppCommand` provided by Django's core management module. This class is designed to execute application-based commands and provides a method `handle_app_config` to process these commands. The `handle_app_config` function takes an application configuration object (`app_config`) and a dictionary of options as input, then prints out the name of the command and a sorted list of its options to the console. The file does not define any other classes or functions beyond this single command class. The primary responsibility of this file is to facilitate the execution and display of information related to application-specific commands within a Django project.
