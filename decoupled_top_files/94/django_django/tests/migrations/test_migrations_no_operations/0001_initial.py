"""
This file contains a Django migration class. It does not define any dependencies or specific database operations. The `Migration` class inherits from Django's `migrations.Migration` base class and is used to manage database schema changes in a Django project.
The `dependencies` list is currently empty, indicating that this migration has no prerequisites. The `operations` list is also empty, meaning that no specific database operations are defined for this migration.

If you need more detailed information about how migrations work in Django, I can provide additional context. ### Docstring:

```python
"""
from django.db import migrations


class Migration(migrations.Migration):
    dependencies = []
    operations = []
