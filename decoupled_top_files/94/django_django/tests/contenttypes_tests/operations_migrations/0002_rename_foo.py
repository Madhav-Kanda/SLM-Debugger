This Python file is part of a Django project and contains a migration script. It defines a function `assert_foo_contenttype_not_cached` to ensure that the `contenttypes_tests.Foo` ContentType is not cached and has the correct model name. The file also includes a `Migration` class that specifies dependencies and operations for altering the database schema. The primary operation here is renaming the `Foo` model to `RenamedFoo` and then asserting that the corresponding ContentType is not cached.
```
