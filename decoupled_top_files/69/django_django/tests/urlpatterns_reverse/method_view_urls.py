# This file contains URL routing configurations for a Django application. It defines a `ViewContainer` class with both instance and class methods to handle HTTP requests. The `urlpatterns` list maps these methods to specific URLs.
#
# **Classes:**
# - `ViewContainer`: A container for views that can be accessed via URLs.
#   - `method_view(request)`: An instance method to handle HTTP requests.
#   - `classmethod_view(request)`: A class method to handle HTTP requests.
#
# **Functions:**
# - `urlpatterns`: A list of URL patterns that map to the methods defined in `ViewContainer`.
#
# **Key Responsibilities:**
# - Define and route HTTP request handlers using Django's URL routing
