The provided Python file contains a single line of code that raises an `AttributeError` with a specific message. This line of code is intended to interfere with the Django URL resolution mechanism, likely as part of a testing or debugging strategy. The file does not define any classes or functions; its sole purpose is to inject an error during the URL loading process, which can be used to trigger specific behavior or to test how the system handles such errors.

### Docstring:
```python
"""
# I just raise an AttributeError to confuse the view loading mechanism
raise AttributeError('I am here to confuse django.urls.get_callable')
