"""
This Python file contains URL routing configuration for a Django web application. It defines a single URL pattern that maps to a lambda function. The lambda function simply returns its input, effectively doing nothing with the request data.

#### Classes:
- None

#### Functions:
- `lambda x: x`: A lambda function that takes an input `x` and returns it unchanged.

#### Key Responsibilities:
- Define a URL pattern for the `/tuple/` endpoint.
- Route requests to the `/tuple/` endpoint to the provided lambda function.

#### Interactions:
- The URL pattern is defined using Django's `urlpatterns` list syntax.
- The lambda function is used as the view for the specified URL, handling incoming requests without any processing.
