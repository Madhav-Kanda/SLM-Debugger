This Python file defines a simple web application error handling mechanism using Django-style URL routing and class-based views.

**Classes:**
- `HandlerView`: A base class for generating view functions for class-based views. It includes a class method `as_view` which returns a generic view function.

**Functions:**
- `HandlerView.as_view()`: A class method that generates a view function for handling HTTP requests. This method is called multiple times to create different error handler views.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- The `HandlerView` class provides a foundation for creating custom view functions that can be used to handle various HTTP errors (400 Bad Request, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 5
