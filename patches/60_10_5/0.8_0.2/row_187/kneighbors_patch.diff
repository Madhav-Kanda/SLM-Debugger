-        """Finds the K-neighbors of a point.

-

-        Returns indices of and distances to the neighbors of each point.

-

-        Parameters

-        ----------

-        X : array-like, shape (n_query, n_features), \

-                or (n_query, n_indexed) if metric == 'precomputed'

-            The query point or points.

-            Indices of the nearest points in the population matrix.

-

-        Examples

-        --------

-        In the following example, we construct a NeighborsClassifier

-        class from an array representing our data set and ask who's

-        the closest point to [1,1,1]
