-def _QRdecomposition(M):

-    r"""Returns a QR decomposition.

-

-    Explanation

-    ===========

-

-    A QR decomposition is a decomposition in the form $A = Q R$

-    where

-

-    - $Q$ is a column orthogonal matrix.

-    - $R$ is a upper triangular (trapezoidal) matrix.

-

-    A column orthogonal matrix satisfies

-    $\mathbb{I} = Q^H Q$ while a full orthogonal matrix satisfies

-    relation $\mathbb{I} = Q Q^H = Q^H Q$ where $I$ is an identity

-    matrix with matching dimensions.

-

-    For matrices which are not square or are rank-deficient, it is

-    sufficient to return a column orthogonal matrix because augmenting

-    them may introduce redundant computations.

-    And an another advantage of this is that you can easily inspect the

-    matrix rank by counting the number of columns of $Q$.

-

-    If you want to augment the results to return a full orthogonal

-    decomposition, you should use the following procedures.

-

-    - Augment the $Q$ matrix with columns that are orthogonal to every

-      other columns and make it square.

-    - Augument the $R$ matrix with zero rows to make it have the same

-      shape as the original matrix.

-

-    The procedure will be illustrated in the examples section.

-

-    Examples

-    ========

-

-    A full rank matrix example:

-

-    >>> from sympy import Matrix

-    >>> A = Matrix([[12, -51, 4], [6, 167, -68], [-4, 24, -41]])

-    >>> Q, R = A.QRdecomposition()

-    >>> Q

-    Matrix([

-    [ 6/7, -69/175, -58/175],

-    [ 3/7, 158/175,   6/175],

-    [-2/7,    6/35,  -33/35]])

-    >>> R

-    Matrix([

-    [14,  21, -14],

-    [ 0, 175, -70],

-    [ 0,   0,  35]])

-

-    If the matrix is square and full rank, the $Q$ matrix becomes

-    orthogonal in both directions, and needs no augmentation.

-

-    >>> Q * Q.H

-    Matrix([

-    [1, 0, 0],

-    [0, 1, 0],

-    [0, 0, 1]])

-    >>> Q.H * Q

-    Matrix([

-    [1, 0, 0],

-    [0, 1, 0],

-    [0, 0, 1]])

-

-    >>> A == Q*R

-    True

-

-    A rank deficient matrix example:

-

-    >>> A = Matrix([[12, -51, 0], [6, 167, 0], [-4, 24, 0]])

-    >>> Q, R = A.QRdecomposition()

-    >>> Q

-    Matrix([

-    [ 6/7, -69/175],

-    [ 3/7, 158/175],

-    [-2/7,    6/35]])

-    >>> R

-    Matrix([

-    [14,  21, 0],

-    [ 0, 175, 0]])

-

-    QRdecomposition might return a matrix Q that is rectangular.

-    In this case the orthogonality condition might be satisfied as

-    $\mathbb{I} = Q.H*Q$ but not in the reversed product

-    $\mathbb{I} = Q * Q.H$.

-

-    >>> Q.H * Q

-    Matrix([

-    [1, 0],

-    [0, 1]])

-    >>> Q * Q.H

-    Matrix([

-    [27261/30625,   348/30625, -1914/6125],

-    [  348/30625, 30589/30625,   198/6125],

-    [ -1914/6125,    198/6125,   136/1225]])

-

-    If you want to augment the results to be a full orthogonal

-    decomposition, you should augment $Q$ with an another orthogonal

-    column.

-

-    You are able to append an arbitrary standard basis that are linearly

-    independent to every other columns and you can run the Gram-Schmidt

-    process to make them augmented as orthogonal basis.

-

-    >>> Q_aug = Q.row_join(Matrix([0, 0, 1]))

-    >>> Q_aug = Q_aug.QRdecomposition()[0]

-    >>> Q_aug

-    Matrix([

-    [ 6/7, -69/175, 58/175],

-    [ 3/7, 158/175, -6/175],

-    [-2/7,    6/35,  33/35]])

-    >>> Q_aug.H * Q_aug

-    Matrix([

-    [1, 0, 0],

-    [0, 1, 0],

-    [0, 0, 1]])

-    >>> Q_aug * Q_aug.H

-    Matrix([

-    [1, 0, 0],

-    [0, 1, 0],

-    [0, 0, 1]])

-

-    Augmenting the $R$ matrix with zero row is straightforward.

-

-    >>> R_aug = R.col_join(Matrix([[0, 0, 0]]))

-    >>> R_aug

-    Matrix([

-    [14,  21, 0],

-    [ 0, 175, 0],

-    [ 0,   0, 0]])

-    >>> Q_aug * R_aug == A

-    True

-

-    A zero matrix example:

-

-    >>> from sympy import Matrix

-    >>> A = Matrix.zeros(3, 4)

-    >>> Q, R = A.QRdecomposition()

-

-    They may return matrices with zero rows and columns.

-

-    >>> Q

-    Matrix(3, 0, [])

-    >>> R

-    Matrix(0, 4, [])

-    >>> Q*R

-    Matrix([

-    [0, 0, 0, 0],

-    [0, 0, 0, 0],

-    [0, 0, 0, 0]])

-

-    As the same augmentation rule described above, $Q$ can be augmented

-    with columns of an identity matrix and $R$ can be augmented with

-    rows of a zero matrix.

-

-    >>> Q_aug = Q.row_join(Matrix.eye(3))

-    >>> R_aug = R.col_join(Matrix.zeros(3, 4))

-    >>> Q_aug * Q_aug.T

-    Matrix([

-    [1, 0, 0],

-    [0, 1, 0],

-    [0, 0, 1]])

-    >>> R_aug

-    Matrix([

-    [0, 0, 0, 0],

-    [0, 0, 0, 0],

-    [0, 0, 0, 0]])

-    >>> Q_aug * R_aug == A

-    True
