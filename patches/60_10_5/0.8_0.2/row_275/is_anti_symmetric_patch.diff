-        that is, M is a square matrix with all M[i, j] == -M[j, i].

-

-        When ``simplify=True`` (default), the sum M[i, j] + M[j, i] is

-        simplified before testing to see if it is zero. By default,

-        the SymPy simplify function is used. To use a custom function

-        set simplify to a function that accepts a single argument which

-        returns a simplified expression. To skip simplification, set

-        simplify to False but note that although this will be faster,

-        it may induce false negatives.

-        ========

-        >>> from sympy import Matrix, symbols

-        >>> m = Matrix(2, 2, [0, 1, -1, 0])

-        >>> m

-        Matrix([

-        [ 0, 1],

-        [-1, 0]])

-        >>> m.is_anti_symmetric()

-        True

-        >>> x, y = symbols('x y')

-        >>> m = Matrix(2, 3, [0, 0, x, -y, 0, 0])

-        >>> m

-        Matrix([

-        [ 0, 0, x],

-        [-y, 0, 0]])

-        >>> m.is_anti_symmetric()

-        False

-

-        >>> from sympy.abc import x, y

-        >>> m = Matrix(3, 3, [0, x**2 + 2*x + 1, y,

-        ...                   -(x + 1)**2 , 0, x*y,

-        ...                   -y, -x*y, 0])

-

-        Simplification of matrix elements is done by default so even

-        though two elements which should be equal and opposite wouldn't

-        pass an equality test, the matrix is still reported as

-        anti-symmetric:

-

-        >>> m[0, 1] == -m[1, 0]

-        False

-        >>> m.is_anti_symmetric()

-        True

-

-        If 'simplify=False' is used for the case when a Matrix is already

-        simplified, this will speed things up. Here, we see that without

-        simplification the matrix does not appear anti-symmetric:

-

-        >>> m.is_anti_symmetric(simplify=False)

-        False

-

-        But if the matrix were already expanded, then it would appear

-        anti-symmetric and simplification in the is_anti_symmetric routine

-        is not needed:

-

-        >>> m = m.expand()

-        >>> m.is_anti_symmetric(simplify=False)

-        True
