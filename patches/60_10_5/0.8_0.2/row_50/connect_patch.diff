-        Arguments:

-

-            receiver

-                A function or an instance method which is to receive signals.

-                Receivers must be hashable objects.

-

-            sender

-                The sender to which the receiver should respond. Must either be

-                a Python object, or None to receive events from any sender.

-

-            weak

-                Whether to use weak references to the receiver. By default, the

-                module will attempt to use weak references to the receiver

-                objects. If this parameter is false, then strong references will

-                be used.

-

-            dispatch_uid

-                An identifier used to uniquely identify a particular instance of

-                a receiver. This will usually be a string, though it may be

-                anything hashable.
