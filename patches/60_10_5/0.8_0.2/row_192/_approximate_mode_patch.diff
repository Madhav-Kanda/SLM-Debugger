-def _approximate_mode(class_counts, n_draws, rng):

-    """Computes approximate mode of multivariate hypergeometric.

-

-    This is an approximation to the mode of the multivariate

-    hypergeometric given by class_counts and n_draws.

-    It shouldn't be off by more than one.

-

-    It is the mostly likely outcome of drawing n_draws many

-    samples from the population given by class_counts.

-

-    Parameters

-    ----------

-    class_counts : ndarray of int

-        Population per class.

-    n_draws : int

-        Number of draws (samples to draw) from the overall population.

-    rng : random state

-        Used to break ties.

-

-    Returns

-    -------

-    sampled_classes : ndarray of int

-        Number of samples drawn from each class.

-        np.sum(sampled_classes) == n_draws

-

-    Examples

-    --------

-    >>> import numpy as np

-    >>> from sklearn.model_selection._split import _approximate_mode

-    >>> _approximate_mode(class_counts=np.array([4, 2]), n_draws=3, rng=0)
