-        ===========

-

-        Subclasses such as Symbol, Function and Derivative return True

-        to enable derivatives wrt them. The implementation in Derivative

-        separates the Symbol and non-Symbol (_diff_wrt=True) variables and

-        temporarily converts the non-Symbols into Symbols when performing

-        the differentiation. By default, any object deriving from Expr

-        will behave like a scalar with self.diff(self) == 1. If this is

-        not desired then the object must also set `is_scalar = False` or

-        else define an _eval_derivative routine.

-

-        Note, see the docstring of Derivative for how this should work

-        mathematically. In particular, note that expr.subs(yourclass, Symbol)

-        should be well-defined on a structural level, or this will lead to

-        inconsistent results.
