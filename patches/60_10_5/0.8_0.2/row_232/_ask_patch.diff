     """

-    Find the truth value for a property of an object.

-

-    This function is called when a request is made to see what a fact

-    value is.

-

-    For this we use several techniques:

-

-    First, the fact-evaluation function is tried, if it exists (for

-    example _eval_is_integer). Then we try related facts. For example

-

-        rational   -->   integer

-

-    another example is joined rule:

-

-        integer & !odd  --> even

-

-    so in the latter case if we are looking at what 'even' value is,

-    'integer' and 'odd' facts will be asked.

-

-    In all cases, when we settle on some fact value, its implications are

-    deduced, and the result is cached in ._assumptions.

+    Decompose a polynomial dictionary into a list of terms.

+

+    Parameters:

+    poly_dict (dict): A dictionary representing the polynomial terms.

+    separate (bool): If True, separate the terms into a list.

+

+    Returns:

+    list: A sorted list of polynomial terms if separate is True, otherwise the dictionary.
