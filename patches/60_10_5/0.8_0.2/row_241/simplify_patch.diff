 def simplify(expr, ratio=1.7, measure=count_ops, rational=False):

-    """

-    Simplifies the given expression.

-

-    Simplification is not a well defined term and the exact strategies

-    this function tries can change in the future versions of SymPy. If

-    your algorithm relies on "simplification" (whatever it is), try to

-    determine what you need exactly  -  is it powsimp()?, radsimp()?,

-    together()?, logcombine()?, or something else? And use this particular

-    function directly, because those are well defined and thus your algorithm

-    will be robust.

-

-    Nonetheless, especially for interactive use, or when you don't know

-    anything about the structure of the expression, simplify() tries to apply

-    intelligent heuristics to make the input expression "simpler".  For

-    example:

-

-    >>> from sympy import simplify, cos, sin

-    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y

-    >>> a = (x + x**2)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)

-    >>> a

-    (x**2 + x)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)

-    >>> simplify(a)

-    x + 1

-

-    Note that we could have obtained the same result by using specific

-    simplification functions:

-

-    >>> from sympy import trigsimp, cancel

-    >>> trigsimp(a)

-    (x**2 + x)/x

-    >>> cancel(_)

-    x + 1

-

-    In some cases, applying :func:`simplify` may actually result in some more

-    complicated expression. The default ``ratio=1.7`` prevents more extreme

-    cases: if (result length)/(input length) > ratio, then input is returned

-    unmodified.  The ``measure`` parameter lets you specify the function used

-    to determine how complex an expression is.  The function should take a

-    single argument as an expression and return a number such that if

-    expression ``a`` is more complex than expression ``b``, then

-    ``measure(a) > measure(b)``.  The default measure function is

-    :func:`count_ops`, which returns the total number of operations in the

-    expression.

-

-    For example, if ``ratio=1``, ``simplify`` output can't be longer

-    than input.

-

-    ::

-

-        >>> from sympy import sqrt, simplify, count_ops, oo

-        >>> root = 1/(sqrt(2)+3)

-

-    Since ``simplify(root)`` would result in a slightly longer expression,

-    root is returned unchanged instead::

-

-       >>> simplify(root, ratio=1) == root

-       True

-

-    If ``ratio=oo``, simplify will be applied anyway::

-

-        >>> count_ops(simplify(root, ratio=oo)) > count_ops(root)

-        True

-

-    Note that the shortest expression is not necessary the simplest, so

-    setting ``ratio`` to 1 may not be a good idea.

-    Heuristically, the default value ``ratio=1.7`` seems like a reasonable

-    choice.

-

-    You can easily define your own measure function based on what you feel

-    should represent the "size" or "complexity" of the input expression.  Note

-    that some choices, such as ``lambda expr: len(str(expr))`` may appear to be

-    good metrics, but have other problems (in this case, the measure function

-    may slow down simplify too much for very large expressions).  If you don't

-    know what a good metric would be, the default, ``count_ops``, is a good

-    one.

-

-    For example:

-

-    >>> from sympy import symbols, log

-    >>> a, b = symbols('a b', positive=True)

-    >>> g = log(a) + log(b) + log(a)*log(1/b)

-    >>> h = simplify(g)

-    >>> h

-    log(a*b**(-log(a) + 1))

-    >>> count_ops(g)

-    8

-    >>> count_ops(h)

-    5

-

-    So you can see that ``h`` is simpler than ``g`` using the count_ops metric.

-    However, we may not like how ``simplify`` (in this case, using

-    ``logcombine``) has created the ``b**(log(1/a) + 1)`` term.  A simple way

-    to reduce this would be to give more weight to powers as operations in

-    ``count_ops``.  We can do this by using the ``visual=True`` option:

-

-    >>> print(count_ops(g, visual=True))

-    2*ADD + DIV + 4*LOG + MUL

-    >>> print(count_ops(h, visual=True))

-    2*LOG + MUL + POW + SUB

-

-    >>> from sympy import Symbol, S

-    >>> def my_measure(expr):

-    ...     POW = Symbol('POW')

-    ...     # Discourage powers by giving POW a weight of 10

-    ...     count = count_ops(expr, visual=True).subs(POW, 10)

-    ...     # Every other operation gets a weight of 1 (the default)

-    ...     count = count.replace(Symbol, type(S.One))

-    ...     return count

-    >>> my_measure(g)

-    8

-    >>> my_measure(h)

-    14

-    >>> 15./8 > 1.7 # 1.7 is the default ratio

-    True

-    >>> simplify(g, measure=my_measure)

-    -log(a)*log(b) + log(a) + log(b)

-

-    Note that because ``simplify()`` internally tries many different

-    simplification strategies and then compares them using the measure

-    function, we get a completely different result that is still different

-    from the input expression by doing this.

-

-    If rational=True, Floats will be recast as Rationals before simplification.

-    If rational=None, Floats will be recast as Rationals but the result will

-    be recast as Floats. If rational=False(default) then nothing will be done

-    to the Floats.
